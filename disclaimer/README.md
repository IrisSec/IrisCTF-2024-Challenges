# Disclaimer - Radio Frequency - 50 points - ? solves

Hey, welcome to the radio frequency category!

Radio hacking can be a lot of fun, but what's not fun is getting the feds knocking at your door, paying fines, and getting your equipment confiscated. Before we let you dig into this category, let's get some housekeeping items out of the way.

**We are not lawyers. We're not your lawyers. This isn't legal advice.**

When playing with radios, never transmit unless you know what you're doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!

**You do not need to transmit for any of these challenges. You do not need any radio hardware for any of these challenges. All of these challenges were made to be solved without the need for real-life hardware.**

This disclaimer isn't meant to deter. It's meant to educate and communicate that you should educate yourself on the specific legalities for your locality if you want to dive into the world of RF. Once again, **this is not legal advice, and you do not need to transmit for any of these challenges.**

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's give you the flag so you can ungate the rest of this category.
