# Sharing is Caring - Networks - ? points - ? solves

Sharing is caring, don't ya know? Sharing a communications channel, that is!

Eve is trying to read Alice's messages, but she doesn't know how to make sense of any of the data being received over the network. This isn't your typical home network either, but something else within the network and communications space.

Eve and Alice are the only people connected to the network in this area. They share the channel, and if anyone else joined the network, they would likewise have to share the channel. Alice has only 1 device and Eve controls the rest. Eve has the signal and of course her own keys, attached.

Can you recover Alice's messages?

**Hint: I wasn't sure whether or not to put this in RF or networks, but decided on networks since the path to get to the solution is more on the theoretical side of the fence and applicable to more than just RF. Hopefully that should give you an idea of where to start!**
