While traveling over the holidays, I was doing some casual wardriving (as I often do). Can you use my capture to find where I went?

Note: the flag is `irisctf{the_location}`, where `the_location` is the **full name** of my destination location, not the street address. For example, `irisctf{Washington_Monument}`. Note that the flag is not case sensitive.
