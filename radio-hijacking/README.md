# Radio Hijacking - Radio Frequency - ? points - ? solves

I was listening to some banger jams on 920 MHz the other day when the broadcast was suddenly interrupted! The channel was just replaced with some erratic bursts of static before it went back to the music. I managed to capture the audio as well as the RF at 2 Msps at the time of the event. What happened?
