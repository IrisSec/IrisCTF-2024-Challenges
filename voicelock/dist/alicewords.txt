CHAPTER I DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE ALICE WAS BEGINNING TO GET VERY TIRED OF SITTING BY HER SISTER ON THE BANK AND OF HAVING NOTHING TO DO ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD PEEPED INTO THE BOOK HER SISTER WAS READING BUT IT HAD NO PICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS IN IT AND WHAT IS THE USE OF A BOOK THOUGHT ALICE WITHOUT PICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS SO SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN HER OWN MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD FOR THE HOT DAY MADE HER FEEL VERY SLEEPY AND STUPID WHETHER THE PLEASURE OF MAKING A DAISY CHAIN WOULD BE WORTH THE TROUBLE OF GETTING UP AND PICKING THE DAISIES WHEN SUDDENLY A WHITE RABBIT WITH PINK EYES RAN CLOSE BY HER THERE WAS NOTHING SO VERY REMARKABLE IN THAT NOR DID ALICE THINK IT SO VERY MUCH OUT OF THE WAY TO HEAR THE RABBIT SAY TO ITSELF OH DEAR OH DEAR I SHALL BE LATE WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARDS IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE WONDERED AT THIS BUT AT THE TIME IT ALL SEEMED QUITE NATURAL BUT WHEN THE RABBIT ACTUALLY TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT POCKET AND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN HURRIED ON ALICE STARTED TO HER FEET FOR IT FLASHED ACROSS HER MIND THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN A RABBIT WITH EITHER A WAISTCOAT POCKET OR A WATCH TO TAKE OUT OF IT AND BURNING WITH CURIOSITY SHE RAN ACROSS THE FIELD AFTER IT AND FORTUNATELY WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT POP DOWN A LARGE RABBIT HOLE UNDER THE HEDGE IN ANOTHER MOMENT DOWN WENT ALICE AFTER IT NEVER ONCE CONSIDERING HOW IN THE WORLD SHE WAS TO GET OUT AGAIN THE RABBIT HOLE WENT STRAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FOR SOME WAY AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN SO SUDDENLY THAT ALICE HAD NOT A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT STOPPING HERSELF BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF FALLING DOWN A VERY DEEP WELL EITHER THE WELL WAS VERY DEEP OR SHE FELL VERY SLOWLY FOR SHE HAD PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT FIRST SHE TRIED TO LOOK DOWN AND MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL AND NOTICED THAT THEY WERE FILLED WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOOK SHELVES HERE AND THERE SHE SAW MAPS AND PICTURES HUNG UPON PEGS SHE TOOK DOWN A JAR FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS SHE PASSED IT WAS LABELLED ORANGE MARMALADE BUT TO HER GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS EMPTY SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DROP THE JAR FOR FEAR OF KILLING SOMEBODY UNDERNEATH SO MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS AS SHE FELL PAST IT WELL THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF AFTER SUCH A FALL AS THIS I SHALL THINK NOTHING OF TUMBLING DOWN STAIRS HOW BRAVE THEYLL ALL THINK ME AT HOME WHY I WOULDNT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT EVEN IF I FELL OFF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS VERY LIKELY TRUE DOWN DOWN DOWN WOULD THE FALL NEVER COME TO AN END I WONDER HOW MANY MILES IVE FALLEN BY THIS TIME SHE SAID ALOUD I MUST BE GETTING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH LET ME SEE THAT WOULD BE FOUR THOUSAND MILES DOWN I THINK FOR YOU SEE ALICE HAD LEARNT SEVERAL THINGS OF THIS SORT IN HER LESSONS IN THE SCHOOLROOM AND THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR SHOWING OFF HER KNOWLEDGE AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO LISTEN TO HER STILL IT WAS GOOD PRACTICE TO SAY IT OVER YES THATS ABOUT THE RIGHT THEN I WONDER WHAT LATITUDE OR LONGITUDE IVE GOT TO ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT LATITUDE WAS OR LONGITUDE EITHER BUT THOUGHT THEY WERE NICE GRAND WORDS TO SAY PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN AGAIN I WONDER IF I SHALL FALL RIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH HOW FUNNY ITLL SEEM TO COME OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT WALK WITH THEIR HEADS DOWNWARD THE ANTIPATHIES I THINK SHE WAS RATHER GLAD THERE WAS NO ONE LISTENING THIS TIME AS IT DIDNT SOUND AT ALL THE RIGHT WORD BUT I SHALL HAVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY IS YOU KNOW PLEASE MAAM IS THIS NEW ZEALAND OR AUSTRALIA AND SHE TRIED TO CURTSEY AS SHE CURTSEYING AS YOURE FALLING THROUGH THE AIR DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE IT AND WHAT AN IGNORANT LITTLE GIRL SHELL THINK ME FOR ASKING NO ITLL NEVER DO TO ASK PERHAPS I SHALL SEE IT WRITTEN UP SOMEWHERE DOWN DOWN DOWN THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO SO ALICE SOON BEGAN TALKING AGAIN MISS ME VERY MUCH TO NIGHT I SHOULD THINK DINAH WAS THE CAT I HOPE THEYLL REMEMBER HER SAUCER OF MILK AT TEA TIME DINAH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WERE DOWN HERE WITH ME THERE ARE NO MICE IN THE AIR IM AFRAID BUT YOU MIGHT CATCH A BAT AND THATS VERY LIKE A MOUSE YOU KNOW BUT DO CATS EAT BATS I WONDER AND HERE ALICE BEGAN TO GET RATHER SLEEPY AND WENT ON SAYING TO HERSELF IN A DREAMY SORT OF WAY DO CATS EAT BATS DO CATS EAT BATS AND SOMETIMES DO BATS EAT CATS FOR YOU SEE AS SHE COULDNT ANSWER EITHER QUESTION IT DIDNT MUCH MATTER WHICH WAY SHE PUT IT SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS DOZING OFF AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO DREAM THAT SHE WAS WALKING HAND IN HAND WITH DINAH AND SAYING TO HER VERY EARNESTLY NOW DINAH TELL ME THE TRUTH DID YOU EVER EAT A BAT WHEN SUDDENLY THUMP THUMP DOWN SHE CAME UPON A HEAP OF STICKS AND DRY LEAVES AND THE FALL WAS OVER ALICE WAS NOT A BIT HURT AND SHE JUMPED UP ON TO HER FEET IN A MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD BEFORE HER WAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE AND THE WHITE RABBIT WAS STILL IN SIGHT HURRYING DOWN IT THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST AWAY WENT ALICE LIKE THE WIND AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR IT SAY AS IT TURNED A CORNER OH MY EARS AND WHISKERS HOW LATE ITS GETTING SHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND IT WHEN SHE TURNED THE CORNER BUT THE RABBIT WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A LONG LOW HALL WHICH WAS LIT UP BY A ROW OF LAMPS HANGING FROM THE ROOF THERE WERE DOORS ALL ROUND THE HALL BUT THEY WERE ALL LOCKED AND WHEN ALICE HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE SIDE AND UP THE OTHER TRYING EVERY DOOR SHE WALKED SADLY DOWN THE MIDDLE WONDERING HOW SHE WAS EVER TO GET OUT AGAIN SUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE THREE LEGGED TABLE ALL MADE OF SOLID GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING ON IT EXCEPT A TINY GOLDEN KEY AND FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL BUT ALAS EITHER THE LOCKS WERE TOO LARGE OR THE KEY WAS TOO SMALL BUT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD NOT OPEN ANY OF THEM HOWEVER ON THE SECOND TIME ROUND SHE CAME UPON A LOW CURTAIN SHE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE AND BEHIND IT WAS A LITTLE DOOR ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES HIGH SHE TRIED THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY IN THE LOCK AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT IT FITTED ALICE OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT IT LED INTO A SMALL PASSAGE NOT MUCH LARGER THAN A RAT HOLE SHE KNELT DOWN AND LOOKED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE LOVELIEST GARDEN YOU EVER SAW HOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THAT DARK HALL AND WANDER ABOUT AMONG THOSE BEDS OF BRIGHT FLOWERS AND THOSE COOL FOUNTAINS BUT SHE COULD NOT EVEN GET HER HEAD THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND EVEN IF MY HEAD WOULD GO THROUGH THOUGHT POOR ALICE IT WOULD BE OF VERY LITTLE USE WITHOUT MY SHOULDERS OH HOW I WISH I COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE I THINK I COULD IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN FOR YOU SEE SO MANY OUT OF THE WAY THINGS HAD HAPPENED LATELY THAT ALICE HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT VERY FEW THINGS INDEED WERE REALLY IMPOSSIBLE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO USE IN WAITING BY THE LITTLE DOOR SO SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE HALF HOPING SHE MIGHT FIND ANOTHER KEY ON IT OR AT ANY RATE A BOOK OF RULES FOR SHUTTING PEOPLE UP LIKE TELESCOPES THIS TIME SHE FOUND A LITTLE BOTTLE ON IT WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT HERE BEFORE SAID ALICE AND ROUND THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE WAS A PAPER LABEL WITH THE WORDS DRINK ME BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY DRINK ME BUT THE WISE LITTLE ALICE WAS NOT GOING TO DO THAT IN A HURRY NO ILL LOOK FIRST SHE SAID AND SEE WHETHER ITS MARKED POISON OR NOT FOR SHE HAD READ SEVERAL NICE LITTLE HISTORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WHO HAD GOT BURNT AND EATEN UP BY WILD BEASTS AND OTHER UNPLEASANT THINGS ALL BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT REMEMBER THE SIMPLE RULES THEIR FRIENDS HAD TAUGHT THEM SUCH AS THAT A RED HOT POKER WILL BURN YOU IF YOU HOLD IT TOO LONG AND THAT IF YOU CUT YOUR FINGER VERY DEEPLY WITH A KNIFE IT USUALLY BLEEDS AND SHE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT IF YOU DRINK MUCH FROM A BOTTLE MARKED POISON IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU SOONER OR LATER HOWEVER THIS BOTTLE WAS NOT MARKED POISON SO ALICE VENTURED TO TASTE IT AND FINDING IT VERY NICE IT HAD IN FACT A SORT OF MIXED FLAVOUR OF CHERRY TART CUSTARD PINE APPLE ROAST TURKEY TOFFEE AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST SHE VERY SOON FINISHED IT OFF WHAT A CURIOUS FEELING SAID ALICE I MUST BE SHUTTING UP LIKE A TELESCOPE AND SO IT WAS INDEED SHE WAS NOW ONLY TEN INCHES HIGH AND HER FACE BRIGHTENED UP AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS NOW THE RIGHT SIZE FOR GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN FIRST HOWEVER SHE WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF SHE WAS GOING TO SHRINK ANY FURTHER SHE FELT A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS FOR IT MIGHT END YOU KNOW SAID ALICE TO HERSELF IN MY GOING OUT ALTOGETHER LIKE A CANDLE I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD BE LIKE THEN AND SHE TRIED TO FANCY WHAT THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IS LIKE AFTER THE CANDLE IS BLOWN OUT FOR SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING SEEN SUCH A THING AFTER A WHILE FINDING THAT NOTHING MORE HAPPENED SHE DECIDED ON GOING INTO THE GARDEN AT ONCE BUT ALAS FOR POOR ALICE WHEN SHE GOT TO THE DOOR SHE FOUND SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE FOR IT SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REACH IT SHE COULD SEE IT QUITE PLAINLY THROUGH THE GLASS AND SHE TRIED HER BEST TO CLIMB UP ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE TABLE BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY AND WHEN SHE HAD TIRED HERSELF OUT WITH TRYING THE POOR LITTLE THING SAT DOWN AND CRIED COME THERES NO USE IN CRYING LIKE THAT SAID ALICE TO HERSELF RATHER SHARPLY I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE OFF THIS MINUTE SHE GENERALLY GAVE HERSELF VERY GOOD ADVICE THOUGH SHE VERY SELDOM FOLLOWED IT AND SOMETIMES SHE SCOLDED HERSELF SO SEVERELY AS TO BRING TEARS INTO HER EYES AND ONCE SHE REMEMBERED TRYING TO BOX HER OWN EARS FOR HAVING CHEATED HERSELF IN A GAME OF CROQUET SHE WAS PLAYING AGAINST HERSELF FOR THIS CURIOUS CHILD WAS VERY FOND OF PRETENDING TO BE TWO PEOPLE BUT ITS NO USE NOW THOUGHT POOR ALICE TO PRETEND TO BE TWO PEOPLE WHY THERES HARDLY ENOUGH OF ME LEFT TO MAKE ONE RESPECTABLE PERSON SOON HER EYE FELL ON A LITTLE GLASS BOX THAT WAS LYING UNDER THE TABLE SHE OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT A VERY SMALL CAKE ON WHICH THE WORDS EAT ME WERE BEAUTIFULLY MARKED IN CURRANTS WELL ILL EAT IT SAID ALICE AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW LARGER I CAN REACH THE KEY AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW SMALLER I CAN CREEP UNDER THE DOOR SO EITHER WAY ILL GET INTO THE GARDEN AND I DONT CARE WHICH HAPPENS SHE ATE A LITTLE BIT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY TO HERSELF WHICH WAY WHICH WAY HOLDING HER HAND ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD TO FEEL WHICH WAY IT WAS GROWING AND SHE WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE REMAINED THE SAME SIZE TO BE SURE THIS GENERALLY HAPPENS WHEN ONE EATS CAKE BUT ALICE HAD GOT SO MUCH INTO THE WAY OF EXPECTING NOTHING BUT OUT OF THE WAY THINGS TO HAPPEN THAT IT SEEMED QUITE DULL AND STUPID FOR LIFE TO GO ON IN THE COMMON WAY SO SHE SET TO WORK AND VERY SOON FINISHED OFF THE CAKE CHAPTER II THE POOL OF TEARS CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER CRIED ALICE SHE WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED THAT FOR THE MOMENT SHE QUITE FORGOT HOW TO SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH NOW IM OPENING OUT LIKE THE LARGEST TELESCOPE THAT EVER WAS GOOD BYE FEET FOR WHEN SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER FEET THEY SEEMED TO BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT THEY WERE GETTING SO FAR OFF OH MY POOR LITTLE FEET I WONDER WHO WILL PUT ON YOUR SHOES AND STOCKINGS FOR YOU NOW DEARS IM SURE I SHANT BE ABLE I SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL TOO FAR OFF TO TROUBLE MYSELF ABOUT YOU YOU MUST MANAGE THE BEST WAY YOU I MUST BE KIND TO THEM THOUGHT ALICE OR PERHAPS THEY WONT WALK THE WAY I WANT TO GO LET ME SEE ILL GIVE THEM A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS EVERY CHRISTMAS AND SHE WENT ON PLANNING TO HERSELF HOW SHE WOULD MANAGE IT THEY MUST GO BY THE CARRIER SHE THOUGHT AND HOW FUNNY ITLL SEEM SENDING PRESENTS TO ONES OWN FEET AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK RIGHT FOOT ESQ HEARTHRUG NEAR THE FENDER WITH LOVE OH DEAR WHAT NONSENSE IM TALKING JUST THEN HER HEAD STRUCK AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE HALL IN FACT SHE WAS NOW MORE THAN NINE FEET HIGH AND SHE AT ONCE TOOK UP THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY AND HURRIED OFF TO THE GARDEN DOOR POOR ALICE IT WAS AS MUCH AS SHE COULD DO LYING DOWN ON ONE SIDE TO LOOK THROUGH INTO THE GARDEN WITH ONE EYE BUT TO GET THROUGH WAS MORE HOPELESS THAN EVER SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF SAID ALICE A GREAT GIRL LIKE YOU SHE MIGHT WELL SAY THIS TO GO ON CRYING IN THIS WAY STOP THIS MOMENT I TELL YOU BUT SHE WENT ON ALL THE SAME SHEDDING GALLONS OF TEARS UNTIL THERE WAS A LARGE POOL ALL ROUND HER ABOUT FOUR INCHES DEEP AND REACHING HALF DOWN THE HALL AFTER A TIME SHE HEARD A LITTLE PATTERING OF FEET IN THE DISTANCE AND SHE HASTILY DRIED HER EYES TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS OH WONT SHE BE SAVAGE IF IVE KEPT HER WAITING ALICE FELT SO DESPERATE THAT SHE WAS READY TO ASK HELP OF ANY ONE SO WHEN THE RABBIT CAME NEAR HER SHE BEGAN IN A LOW TIMID VOICE IF YOU PLEASE SIR THE RABBIT STARTED VIOLENTLY DROPPED THE WHITE KID GLOVES AND THE FAN AND AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS AS HARD AS HE COULD GO ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL I WONDER IF IVE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT LET ME THINK WAS I THE SAME WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT IF IM NOT THE SAME THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHO IN THE WORLD AM I AH THATS THE GREAT PUZZLE AND SHE BEGAN THINKING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN SHE KNEW THAT WERE OF THE SAME AGE AS HERSELF TO SEE IF SHE COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR ANY OF THEM IM SURE IM NOT ADA SHE SAID FOR HER HAIR GOES IN SUCH LONG RINGLETS AND MINE DOESNT GO IN RINGLETS AT ALL AND IM SURE I CANT BE MABEL FOR I KNOW ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND SHE OH SHE KNOWS SUCH A VERY LITTLE BESIDES SHES SHE AND IM I DEAR HOW PUZZLING IT ALL IS ILL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW LET ME SEE FOUR TIMES FIVE IS TWELVE AND FOUR TIMES SIX IS THIRTEEN AND FOUR TIMES SEVEN DEAR I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE HOWEVER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE DOESNT SIGNIFY LETS TRY GEOGRAPHY LONDON IS THE CAPITAL OF PARIS AND PARIS IS THE CAPITAL OF ROME AND THATS ALL WRONG IM CERTAIN I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR MABEL ILL TRY AND SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE AND SHE CROSSED HER HANDS ON HER LAP AS IF SHE WERE SAYING LESSONS AND BEGAN TO REPEAT IT BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED HOARSE AND STRANGE AND THE WORDS DID NOT COME THE SAME AS THEY USED TO DO HOW DOTH THE LITTLE CROCODILE IMPROVE HIS SHINING TAIL AND POUR THE WATERS OF THE NILE ON EVERY GOLDEN SCALE HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS IM SURE THOSE ARE NOT THE RIGHT WORDS SAID POOR ALICE AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AGAIN AS SHE WENT ON I MUST BE MABEL AFTER ALL AND I SHALL HAVE TO GO AND LIVE IN THAT POKY LITTLE HOUSE AND HAVE NEXT TO NO TOYS TO PLAY WITH AND OH EVER SO MANY LESSONS TO LEARN NO IVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF IM MABEL ILL STAY DOWN HERE ITLL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR I SHALL ONLY LOOK UP AND SAY WHO AM I THEN TELL ME THAT FIRST AND THEN IF I LIKE BEING THAT PERSON ILL COME UP IF NOT ILL STAY DOWN HERE TILL IM SOMEBODY OH DEAR CRIED ALICE WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF TEARS I DO WISH THEY WOULD PUT THEIR HEADS DOWN I AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE AS SHE SAID THIS SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SHE HAD PUT ON ONE OF THE RABBITS LITTLE WHITE KID GLOVES WHILE SHE WAS TALKING HOW CAN I HAVE DONE THAT SHE THOUGHT I MUST BE GROWING SMALL AGAIN SHE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE TABLE TO MEASURE HERSELF BY IT AND FOUND THAT AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD GUESS SHE WAS NOW ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH AND WAS GOING ON SHRINKING RAPIDLY SHE SOON FOUND OUT THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS THE FAN SHE WAS HOLDING AND SHE DROPPED IT HASTILY JUST IN TIME TO AVOID SHRINKING AWAY ALTOGETHER THAT WAS A NARROW ESCAPE SAID ALICE A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED AT THE SUDDEN CHANGE BUT VERY GLAD TO FIND HERSELF STILL IN EXISTENCE AND NOW FOR THE GARDEN AND SHE RAN WITH ALL SPEED BACK TO THE LITTLE DOOR BUT ALAS THE LITTLE DOOR WAS SHUT AGAIN AND THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY WAS LYING ON THE GLASS TABLE AS BEFORE AND THINGS ARE WORSE THAN EVER THOUGHT THE POOR CHILD FOR I NEVER WAS SO SMALL AS THIS BEFORE NEVER AND I DECLARE ITS TOO BAD THAT IT IS AS SHE SAID THESE WORDS HER FOOT SLIPPED AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SPLASH SHE WAS UP TO HER CHIN IN SALT WATER HER FIRST IDEA WAS THAT SHE HAD SOMEHOW FALLEN INTO THE SEA AND IN THAT CASE I CAN GO BACK BY RAILWAY SHE SAID TO HERSELF ALICE HAD BEEN TO THE SEASIDE ONCE IN HER LIFE AND HAD COME TO THE GENERAL CONCLUSION THAT WHEREVER YOU GO TO ON THE ENGLISH COAST YOU FIND A NUMBER OF BATHING MACHINES IN THE SEA SOME CHILDREN DIGGING IN THE SAND WITH WOODEN SPADES THEN A ROW OF LODGING HOUSES AND BEHIND THEM A RAILWAY STATION HOWEVER SHE SOON MADE OUT THAT SHE WAS IN THE POOL OF TEARS WHICH SHE HAD WEPT WHEN SHE WAS NINE FEET HIGH I WISH I HADNT CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE HOWEVER EVERYTHING IS QUEER TO DAY JUST THEN SHE HEARD SOMETHING SPLASHING ABOUT IN THE POOL A LITTLE WAY OFF AND SHE SWAM NEARER TO MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A WALRUS OR HIPPOPOTAMUS BUT THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW SMALL SHE WAS NOW AND SHE SOON MADE OUT THAT IT WAS ONLY A MOUSE THAT HAD SLIPPED IN LIKE HERSELF WOULD IT BE OF ANY USE NOW THOUGHT ALICE TO SPEAK TO THIS MOUSE EVERYTHING IS SO OUT OF THE WAY DOWN HERE THAT I SHOULD THINK VERY LIKELY IT CAN TALK AT ANY RATE THERES NO HARM IN TRYING SO SHE BEGAN O MOUSE DO YOU KNOW THE WAY OUT OF THIS POOL I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O

AT HER RATHER INQUISITIVELY AND SEEMED TO HER TO WINK WITH ONE OF ITS LITTLE EYES BUT IT SAID NOTHING PERHAPS IT DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH THOUGHT ALICE I DARESAY ITS A FRENCH MOUSE COME OVER WITH

WITH DRAGGLED FEATHERS THE ANIMALS WITH THEIR FUR CLINGING CLOSE TO THEM AND ALL DRIPPING WET CROSS AND UNCOMFORTABLE THE FIRST QUESTION OF COURSE WAS HOW TO GET DRY AGAIN THEY HAD A CONSULTATION ABOUT THIS AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT SEEMED QUITE NATURAL TO ALICE TO FIND HERSELF TALKING FAMILIARLY WITH THEM AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM ALL HER LIFE INDEED SHE HAD QUITE A LONG ARGUMENT WITH THE LORY WHO AT LAST TURNED SULKY AND WOULD ONLY SAY I AM OLDER THAN YOU AND MUST KNOW BETTER AND THIS ALICE WOULD NOT ALLOW WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OLD IT WAS AND AS THE LORY POSITIVELY REFUSED TO TELL ITS

SAID THE DODO IN AN OFFENDED TONE WAS THAT THE BEST THING TO GET US DRY WOULD BE A CAUCUS RACE WHAT IS A CAUCUS RACE SAID ALICE NOT THAT SHE WANTED MUCH TO KNOW BUT THE DODO HAD PAUSED AS IF IT THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SPEAK AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMED INCLINED TO SAY ANYTHING WHY SAID THE DODO THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IS TO DO IT AND AS YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TRY THE THING YOURSELF SOME WINTER DAY I WILL TELL YOU HOW THE DODO MANAGED IT FIRST IT MARKED OUT A RACE COURSE IN A SORT OF CIRCLE THE EXACT SHAPE DOESNT MATTER IT SAID AND THEN ALL THE PARTY WERE PLACED ALONG THE COURSE HERE AND THERE THERE WAS NO ONE TWO THREE AND AWAY BUT THEY BEGAN RUNNING WHEN THEY LIKED AND LEFT OFF WHEN THEY LIKED SO THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO KNOW WHEN THE RACE WAS OVER HOWEVER WHEN THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING HALF AN HOUR OR SO AND WERE QUITE DRY AGAIN THE DODO SUDDENLY CALLED OUT THE RACE IS OVER AND THEY ALL CROWDED ROUND IT PANTING AND ASKING BUT WHO HAS WON THIS QUESTION THE DODO COULD NOT ANSWER WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT AND IT SAT FOR A LONG TIME WITH ONE FINGER PRESSED UPON ITS FOREHEAD THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU USUALLY SEE SHAKESPEARE IN THE PICTURES OF HIM WHILE THE REST WAITED IN SILENCE AT LAST THE DODO SAID EVERYBODY HAS WON AND ALL MUST HAVE PRIZES BUT WHO IS TO GIVE THE PRIZES QUITE A CHORUS OF VOICES ASKED WHY SHE OF COURSE SAID THE DODO POINTING TO ALICE WITH ONE FINGER AND THE WHOLE PARTY AT ONCE CROWDED ROUND HER CALLING OUT IN A CONFUSED WAY PRIZES PRIZES ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO AND IN DESPAIR SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET AND PULLED OUT A BOX OF COMFITS LUCKILY THE SALT WATER HAD NOT GOT INTO IT AND HANDED THEM ROUND AS PRIZES THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE A PIECE ALL ROUND BUT SHE MUST HAVE A PRIZE HERSELF YOU KNOW SAID THE MOUSE OF COURSE THE DODO

THEY ALL LOOKED SO GRAVE THAT SHE DID NOT DARE TO LAUGH AND AS SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY SHE SIMPLY BOWED AND TOOK THE THIMBLE LOOKING AS SOLEMN AS SHE COULD THE NEXT THING WAS TO EAT THE COMFITS THIS CAUSED SOME NOISE AND CONFUSION AS THE LARGE BIRDS COMPLAINED THAT THEY COULD NOT TASTE THEIRS AND THE SMALL ONES CHOKED AND HAD TO BE PATTED ON THE BACK HOWEVER IT WAS OVER AT LAST AND

NEVERTHELESS SHE UNCORKED IT AND PUT IT TO HER LIPS I KNOW SOMETHING INTERESTING IS SURE TO HAPPEN SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHENEVER I EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING SO ILL JUST SEE WHAT THIS BOTTLE DOES I DO HOPE ITLL MAKE ME GROW LARGE AGAIN FOR REALLY IM QUITE TIRED OF BEING SUCH A TINY LITTLE THING IT DID SO INDEED AND MUCH SOONER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED BEFORE SHE HAD DRUNK HALF THE BOTTLE SHE FOUND HER HEAD PRESSING AGAINST THE CEILING AND HAD TO STOOP TO SAVE HER NECK FROM BEING BROKEN SHE HASTILY PUT DOWN THE BOTTLE SAYING TO HERSELF THATS QUITE HOPE I SHANT GROW ANY IT IS I CANT GET OUT AT THE DO WISH I HADNT DRUNK QUITE SO MUCH ALAS IT WAS TOO LATE TO WISH THAT SHE WENT ON GROWING AND GROWING AND VERY SOON HAD TO KNEEL DOWN ON THE FLOOR IN ANOTHER MINUTE THERE WAS NOT EVEN ROOM FOR THIS AND SHE TRIED THE EFFECT OF LYING DOWN WITH ONE ELBOW AGAINST THE DOOR AND THE OTHER ARM CURLED ROUND HER HEAD STILL SHE WENT ON GROWING AND AS A LAST RESOURCE SHE PUT ONE ARM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ONE FOOT UP THE CHIMNEY AND SAID TO HERSELF NOW I CAN DO NO MORE WHATEVER HAPPENS WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME LUCKILY FOR ALICE THE LITTLE MAGIC BOTTLE HAD NOW HAD ITS FULL EFFECT AND SHE GREW NO LARGER STILL IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO SORT OF CHANCE OF HER EVER GETTING OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN NO WONDER SHE FELT UNHAPPY IT WAS MUCH PLEASANTER AT HOME THOUGHT POOR ALICE WHEN ONE WASNT ALWAYS GROWING LARGER AND SMALLER AND BEING ORDERED ABOUT BY MICE AND RABBITS I ALMOST WISH I HADNT GONE DOWN THAT RABBIT RATHER CURIOUS YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF LIFE I DO WONDER WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I USED TO READ FAIRY TALES I FANCIED THAT KIND OF THING NEVER HAPPENED AND NOW HERE I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE THERE OUGHT TO BE A BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT ME THAT THERE OUGHT AND WHEN I GROW UP ILL WRITE IM GROWN UP NOW SHE ADDED IN A SORROWFUL TONE AT LEAST THERES NO ROOM TO GROW UP ANY MORE HERE BUT THEN THOUGHT ALICE SHALL I NEVER GET ANY OLDER THAN I AM NOW THATLL BE A COMFORT ONE TO BE AN OLD TO HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN OH I SHOULDNT LIKE THAT OH YOU FOOLISH ALICE SHE ANSWERED HERSELF HOW CAN YOU LEARN LESSONS IN HERE WHY THERES HARDLY ROOM FOR YOU AND NO ROOM AT ALL FOR ANY LESSON BOOKS AND SO SHE WENT ON TAKING FIRST ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER AND MAKING QUITE A CONVERSATION OF IT ALTOGETHER BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SHE HEARD A VOICE OUTSIDE AND STOPPED TO LISTEN MARY ANN MARY ANN SAID THE VOICE FETCH ME MY GLOVES THIS MOMENT THEN CAME A LITTLE PATTERING OF FEET ON THE STAIRS ALICE KNEW IT WAS THE RABBIT COMING TO LOOK FOR HER AND SHE TREMBLED TILL SHE SHOOK THE HOUSE QUITE FORGETTING THAT SHE WAS NOW ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES AS LARGE AS THE RABBIT AND HAD NO REASON TO BE AFRAID OF IT PRESENTLY THE RABBIT CAME UP TO THE DOOR AND TRIED TO OPEN IT BUT AS THE DOOR OPENED INWARDS AND ELBOW WAS PRESSED HARD AGAINST IT THAT ATTEMPT PROVED A FAILURE ALICE HEARD IT SAY TO ITSELF THEN ILL GO ROUND AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW THAT YOU WONT THOUGHT ALICE AND AFTER WAITING TILL SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD THE RABBIT JUST UNDER THE WINDOW SHE SUDDENLY SPREAD OUT HER HAND AND MADE A SNATCH IN THE AIR SHE DID NOT GET HOLD OF ANYTHING BUT SHE HEARD A LITTLE SHRIEK AND A FALL AND A CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FROM WHICH SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE IT HAD FALLEN INTO A CUCUMBER FRAME OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT NEXT CAME AN ANGRY PAT WHERE ARE YOU AND THEN A VOICE SHE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE SURE THEN IM HERE DIGGING FOR APPLES YER HONOUR DIGGING FOR APPLES INDEED SAID THE RABBIT ANGRILY HERE COME AND HELP ME OUT OF THIS SOUNDS OF MORE BROKEN GLASS NOW TELL ME PAT WHATS

GOT NO BUSINESS THERE AT ANY RATE GO AND TAKE IT AWAY THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE AFTER THIS AND ALICE COULD ONLY HEAR WHISPERS NOW AND THEN SUCH AS SURE I DONT LIKE IT YER HONOUR AT ALL AT ALL DO AS I TELL YOU YOU COWARD AND AT LAST SHE SPREAD OUT HER HAND AGAIN AND MADE ANOTHER SNATCH IN THE AIR THIS TIME THERE WERE TWO LITTLE SHRIEKS AND MORE SOUNDS OF BROKEN GLASS WHAT A NUMBER OF CUCUMBER FRAMES THERE MUST BE THOUGHT ALICE I WONDER WHAT THEYLL DO NEXT AS FOR PULLING ME OUT OF THE WINDOW I ONLY WISH THEY COULD IM SURE I DONT WANT TO STAY IN HERE ANY LONGER SHE WAITED FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT HEARING ANYTHING MORE AT LAST CAME A RUMBLING OF LITTLE CARTWHEELS AND THE SOUND OF A GOOD MANY VOICES ALL TALKING TOGETHER SHE MADE OUT THE WORDS WHERES THE OTHER I HADNT TO BRING BUT ONE BILLS GOT THE FETCH IT HERE PUT EM UP AT THIS TIE EM TOGETHER DONT REACH HALF HIGH ENOUGH THEYLL DO WELL ENOUGH DONT BE BILL CATCH HOLD OF THIS THE ROOF THAT LOOSE ITS COMING DOWN HEADS BELOW A LOUD WHO DID WAS BILL I TO GO DOWN THE I SHANT YOU DO I WONT TO GO BILL THE MASTER SAYS YOURE TO GO DOWN THE CHIMNEY OH SO BILLS GOT TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY HAS HE SAID ALICE TO HERSELF SHY THEY SEEM TO PUT EVERYTHING UPON BILL I WOULDNT BE IN BILLS PLACE FOR A GOOD DEAL THIS FIREPLACE IS NARROW TO BE SURE BUT I THINK I CAN KICK A LITTLE SHE DREW HER FOOT AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS SHE COULD AND WAITED TILL SHE HEARD A LITTLE ANIMAL SHE COULDNT GUESS OF WHAT SORT IT WAS SCRATCHING AND SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN THE CHIMNEY CLOSE ABOVE HER THEN SAYING TO HERSELF THIS IS BILL SHE GAVE ONE SHARP KICK AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT THE FIRST THING SHE HEARD WAS A GENERAL CHORUS OF THERE GOES BILL THEN THE RABBITS VOICE HIM YOU BY THE HEDGE THEN SILENCE AND THEN ANOTHER CONFUSION OF UP HIS CHOKE WAS IT OLD FELLOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU TELL US ALL ABOUT IT LAST CAME A LITTLE FEEBLE SQUEAKING VOICE THATS BILL THOUGHT ALICE WELL I HARDLY MORE THANK YE IM BETTER IM A DEAL TOO FLUSTERED TO TELL I KNOW IS SOMETHING COMES AT ME LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX AND UP I GOES LIKE A SKY ROCKET SO YOU DID OLD FELLOW SAID THE OTHERS WE MUST BURN THE HOUSE DOWN SAID THE RABBITS VOICE AND ALICE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD IF YOU DO ILL SET DINAH AT YOU THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY AND ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT IF THEY HAD ANY SENSE THEYD TAKE THE ROOF OFF AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO THEY BEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN AND ALICE HEARD THE RABBIT SAY A BARROWFUL WILL DO TO BEGIN WITH A BARROWFUL OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE BUT SHE HAD NOT LONG TO DOUBT FOR THE NEXT MOMENT A SHOWER OF LITTLE PEBBLES CAME RATTLING IN AT THE WINDOW AND SOME OF THEM HIT HER IN THE FACE ILL PUT A STOP TO THIS SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHOUTED OUT YOUD BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN WHICH PRODUCED ANOTHER DEAD SILENCE ALICE NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT THE PEBBLES WERE ALL TURNING INTO LITTLE CAKES AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOOR AND A BRIGHT IDEA CAME INTO HER HEAD IF I EAT ONE OF THESE CAKES SHE THOUGHT ITS SURE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE IN MY SIZE AND AS IT CANT POSSIBLY MAKE ME LARGER IT MUST MAKE ME SMALLER I SUPPOSE SO SHE SWALLOWED ONE OF THE CAKES AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT SHE BEGAN SHRINKING DIRECTLY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR SHE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND FOUND QUITE A CROWD OF LITTLE ANIMALS AND BIRDS WAITING OUTSIDE THE POOR LITTLE LIZARD BILL WAS IN THE MIDDLE BEING HELD UP BY TWO GUINEA PIGS WHO WERE GIVING IT SOMETHING OUT OF A BOTTLE THEY ALL MADE A RUSH AT ALICE THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED BUT SHE RAN OFF AS HARD AS SHE COULD AND SOON FOUND HERSELF SAFE IN A THICK WOOD THE FIRST THING IVE GOT TO DO SAID ALICE TO HERSELF AS SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD IS TO GROW TO MY RIGHT SIZE AGAIN AND THE SECOND THING IS TO FIND MY WAY INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST PLAN IT SOUNDED AN EXCELLENT PLAN NO DOUBT AND VERY NEATLY AND SIMPLY ARRANGED THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST IDEA HOW TO SET ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE WAS PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUSLY AMONG THE TREES A LITTLE SHARP BARK JUST OVER HER HEAD MADE HER LOOK UP IN A GREAT HURRY AN ENORMOUS PUPPY WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH LARGE ROUND EYES AND FEEBLY STRETCHING OUT ONE PAW TRYING TO TOUCH HER POOR LITTLE THING SAID ALICE IN A COAXING TONE AND SHE TRIED HARD TO WHISTLE TO IT BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED ALL THE TIME AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGRY IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO EAT HER UP IN SPITE OF ALL HER COAXING HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID SHE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OF STICK AND HELD IT OUT TO THE PUPPY WHEREUPON THE PUPPY JUMPED INTO THE AIR OFF ALL ITS FEET AT ONCE WITH A YELP OF DELIGHT AND RUSHED AT THE STICK AND MADE BELIEVE TO WORRY IT THEN ALICE DODGED BEHIND A GREAT THISTLE TO KEEP HERSELF FROM BEING RUN OVER AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE PUPPY MADE ANOTHER RUSH AT THE STICK AND TUMBLED HEAD OVER HEELS IN ITS HURRY TO GET HOLD OF IT THEN ALICE THINKING IT WAS VERY LIKE HAVING A GAME OF PLAY WITH A CART HORSE AND EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER ITS FEET RAN ROUND THE THISTLE AGAIN THEN THE PUPPY BEGAN A SERIES OF SHORT CHARGES AT THE STICK RUNNING A VERY LITTLE WAY FORWARDS EACH TIME AND A LONG WAY BACK AND BARKING HOARSELY ALL THE WHILE TILL AT LAST IT SAT DOWN A GOOD WAY OFF PANTING WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND ITS GREAT EYES HALF SHUT THIS SEEMED TO ALICE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING HER ESCAPE SO SHE SET OFF AT ONCE AND RAN TILL SHE WAS QUITE TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH AND TILL THE BARK SOUNDED QUITE FAINT IN THE DISTANCE AND YET WHAT A DEAR LITTLE PUPPY IT WAS SAID ALICE AS SHE LEANT AGAINST A BUTTERCUP TO REST HERSELF AND FANNED HERSELF WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TRICKS VERY MUCH ID ONLY BEEN THE RIGHT SIZE TO DO IT OH DEAR ID NEARLY FORGOTTEN THAT IVE GOT TO GROW UP AGAIN LET ME IS IT TO BE MANAGED I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO EAT OR DRINK SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS WHAT THE GREAT QUESTION CERTAINLY WAS WHAT ALICE LOOKED ALL ROUND HER AT THE FLOWERS AND THE BLADES OF GRASS BUT SHE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO EAT OR DRINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS A LARGE MUSHROOM GROWING NEAR HER ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS HERSELF AND WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UNDER IT AND ON BOTH SIDES OF IT AND BEHIND IT IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK AND SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TOP OF IT SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MUSHROOM AND HER EYES IMMEDIATELY MET THOSE OF A LARGE BLUE CATERPILLAR THAT WAS SITTING ON THE TOP WITH ITS ARMS FOLDED QUIETLY SMOKING A LONG HOOKAH AND TAKING NOT THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF HER OR OF ANYTHING ELSE CHAPTER V ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY II HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF I CANT EXPLAIN MYSELF IM AFRAID SIR SAID ALICE BECAUSE IM NOT MYSELF YOU SEE I DONT SEE SAID THE CATERPILLAR IM AFRAID I CANT PUT IT MORE CLEARLY ALICE REPLIED VERY POLITELY FOR I CANT UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING IT ISNT SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVENT FOUND IT SO YET SAID ALICE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO A WILL SOME DAY YOU THEN AFTER THAT INTO A BUTTERFLY I SHOULD THINK FEEL IT A LITTLE QUEER WONT YOU NOT A BIT SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT SAID ALICE ALL I KNOW IS IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO ME YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY WHO ARE YOU WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION ALICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE CATERPILLARS MAKING SUCH VERY SHORT REMARKS AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID VERY GRAVELY I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE FIRST WHY SAID THE CATERPILLAR HERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION AND AS ALICE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GOOD REASON AND AS THE CATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND SHE TURNED AWAY COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER IVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR IS THAT ALL SAID ALICE SWALLOWING DOWN HER ANGER AS WELL AS SHE COULD NO SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL WAIT AS SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT MIGHT TELL HER SOMETHING WORTH HEARING FOR SOME MINUTES IT PUFFED AWAY WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT AT LAST IT UNFOLDED ITS ARMS TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AGAIN AND SAID SO YOU THINK YOURE CHANGED DO YOU IM AFRAID I AM SIR SAID ALICE I CANT REMEMBER THINGS AS I I DONT KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER CANT REMEMBER WHAT THINGS SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL IVE TRIED TO SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE BUT IT ALL CAME DIFFERENT ALICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE REPEAT YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM THE YOUNG MAN SAID AND YOUR HAIR HAS BECOME VERY WHITE AND YET YOU INCESSANTLY STAND ON YOUR HEAD DO YOU THINK AT YOUR AGE IT IS RIGHT IN MY YOUTH FATHER WILLIAM REPLIED TO HIS SON I FEARED IT MIGHT INJURE THE BRAIN BUT NOW THAT IM PERFECTLY SURE I HAVE NONE WHY I DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH AS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND HAVE GROWN MOST UNCOMMONLY FAT YET YOU TURNED A BACK SOMERSAULT IN AT THE DOOR PRAY WHAT IS THE REASON OF THAT IN MY YOUTH SAID THE SAGE AS HE SHOOK HIS GREY LOCKS I KEPT ALL MY LIMBS VERY SUPPLE BY THE USE OF THIS SHILLING THE BOX ALLOW ME TO SELL YOU A COUPLE YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH AND YOUR JAWS ARE TOO WEAK FOR ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN SUET YET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK PRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT IN MY YOUTH SAID HIS FATHER I TOOK TO THE LAW AND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE AND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW HAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH ONE WOULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT YOUR EYE WAS AS STEADY AS EVER YET YOU BALANCED AN EEL ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE WHAT MADE YOU SO AWFULLY CLEVER I HAVE ANSWERED THREE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HIS FATHER DONT GIVE YOURSELF AIRS DO YOU THINK I CAN LISTEN ALL DAY TO SUCH STUFF BE OFF OR ILL KICK YOU DOWN STAIRS THAT IS NOT SAID RIGHT SAID THE CATERPILLAR NOT QUITE RIGHT IM AFRAID SAID ALICE TIMIDLY SOME OF THE WORDS HAVE GOT ALTERED IT IS WRONG FROM BEGINNING TO END SAID THE CATERPILLAR DECIDEDLY AND THERE WAS SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES THE CATERPILLAR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK WHAT SIZE DO YOU WANT TO BE IT ASKED OH IM NOT PARTICULAR AS TO SIZE ALICE HASTILY REPLIED ONLY ONE DOESNT LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN YOU KNOW I DONT KNOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER ARE YOU CONTENT NOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE LARGER SIR IF YOU WOULDNT MIND SAID ALICE THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHED HEIGHT TO BE IT IS A VERY GOOD HEIGHT INDEED SAID THE CATERPILLAR ANGRILY REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AS IT SPOKE IT WAS EXACTLY THREE INCHES HIGH BUT IM NOT USED TO IT PLEADED POOR ALICE IN A PITEOUS TONE AND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF I WISH THE CREATURES WOULDNT BE SO EASILY OFFENDED GET USED TO IT IN TIME SAID THE CATERPILLAR AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF OF THE MUSHROOM SAID THE CATERPILLAR JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT AND AS IT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION HOWEVER AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEY WOULD GO AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE BIT COME MY HEADS FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER SHOULDERS WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ALL SHE COULD SEE WHEN SHE LOOKED DOWN WAS AN IMMENSE LENGTH OF NECK WHICH SEEMED TO RISE LIKE A STALK OUT OF A SEA OF GREEN LEAVES THAT LAY FAR BELOW HER WHAT CAN ALL THAT GREEN STUFF BE SAID ALICE AND WHERE HAVE MY SHOULDERS GOT TO AND OH MY POOR HANDS HOW IS IT I CANT SEE YOU SHE WAS MOVING THEM ABOUT AS SHE SPOKE BUT NO RESULT SEEMED TO FOLLOW EXCEPT A LITTLE SHAKING AMONG THE DISTANT GREEN LEAVES AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANCE OF GETTING HER HANDS UP TO HER HEAD SHE TRIED TO GET HER HEAD DOWN TO THEM AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION LIKE A SERPENT SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON IM NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB IVE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM I HAVENT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT SAID ALICE IVE TRIED THE ROOTS OF TREES AND IVE TRIED BANKS AND IVE TRIED HEDGES THE PIGEON WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER BUT THOSE SERPENTS THERES NO PLEASING THEM ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASNT TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY WHY I HAVENT HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS IM VERY SORRY YOUVE BEEN ANNOYED SAID ALICE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING AND JUST AS ID TAKEN THE HIGHEST TREE IN THE WOOD CONTINUED THE PIGEON RAISING ITS VOICE TO A SHRIEK AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT IM NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE IM AIM A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON I CAN SEE YOURE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALICE RATHER DOUBTFULLY AS SHE REMEMBERED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT DAY A LIKELY STORY INDEED SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT IVE SEEN A GOOD MANY LITTLE GIRLS IN MY TIME BUT NEVER ONE WITH SUCH A NECK AS THAT NO NO YOURE A SERPENT AND THERES NO USE DENYING IT I SUPPOSE BE TELLING ME NEXT THAT YOU NEVER TASTED AN EGG I HAVE TASTED EGGS CERTAINLY SAID ALICE WHO WAS A VERY TRUTHFUL CHILD BUT LITTLE GIRLS EAT EGGS QUITE AS MUCH AS SERPENTS DO YOU KNOW I DONT BELIEVE IT SAID THE PIGEON BUT IF THEY DO WHY THEN THEYRE A KIND OF SERPENT THATS ALL I CAN SAY THIS WAS SUCH A NEW IDEA TO ALICE THAT SHE WAS QUITE SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO WHICH GAVE THE PIGEON THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING YOURE LOOKING FOR EGGS I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER YOURE A LITTLE GIRL OR A SERPENT IT MATTERS A GOOD DEAL TO ME SAID ALICE HASTILY BUT IM NOT LOOKING FOR EGGS AS IT HAPPENS AND IF I WAS I SHOULDNT WANT YOURS I DONT LIKE THEM RAW WELL BE OFF THEN SAID THE PIGEON IN A SULKY TONE AS IT SETTLED DOWN AGAIN INTO ITS NEST ALICE CROUCHED DOWN AMONG THE TREES AS WELL AS SHE COULD FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY NIBBLING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER AND GROWING SOMETIMES TALLER AND SOMETIMES SHORTER UNTIL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HERSELF DOWN TO HER USUAL HEIGHT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEAR THE RIGHT SIZE THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERES HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE IM NEVER SURE WHAT IM GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER HOWEVER IVE GOT BACK TO MY RIGHT SIZE THE NEXT THING IS TO GET INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL IS THAT TO BE DONE I WONDER AS SHE SAID THIS SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON AN OPEN PLACE WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH WHOEVER LIVES THERE THOUGHT ALICE ITLL NEVER DO TO COME UPON THEM THIS SIZE WHY I SHOULD FRIGHTEN THEM OUT OF THEIR WITS SO SHE BEGAN NIBBLING AT THE RIGHTHAND BIT AGAIN AND DID NOT VENTURE TO GO NEAR THE HOUSE TILL SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF DOWN TO NINE INCHES HIGH CHAPTER VI PIG AND PEPPER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE STOOD LOOKING AT THE HOUSE AND WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT WHEN SUDDENLY A FOOTMAN IN LIVERY CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE CONSIDERED HIM TO BE A FOOTMAN BECAUSE HE WAS IN LIVERY OTHERWISE JUDGING BY HIS FACE ONLY SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A RAPPED LOUDLY AT THE DOOR WITH HIS KNUCKLES IT WAS OPENED BY ANOTHER FOOTMAN IN LIVERY WITH A ROUND FACE AND LARGE EYES LIKE A FROG AND BOTH FOOTMEN ALICE NOTICED HAD POWDERED HAIR THAT CURLED ALL OVER THEIR HEADS SHE FELT VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND CREPT A LITTLE WAY OUT OF THE WOOD TO LISTEN THE FISH FOOTMAN BEGAN BY PRODUCING FROM UNDER HIS ARM A GREAT LETTER NEARLY AS LARGE AS HIMSELF AND THIS HE HANDED OVER TO THE OTHER SAYING IN A SOLEMN TONE FOR THE DUCHESS AN INVITATION FROM THE QUEEN TO PLAY CROQUET THE FROG FOOTMAN REPEATED IN THE SAME SOLEMN TONE ONLY CHANGING THE ORDER OF THE WORDS A LITTLE FROM THE QUEEN AN INVITATION FOR THE DUCHESS TO PLAY CROQUET THEN THEY BOTH BOWED LOW AND THEIR CURLS GOT ENTANGLED TOGETHER ALICE LAUGHED SO MUCH AT THIS THAT SHE HAD TO RUN BACK INTO THE WOOD FOR FEAR OF THEIR HEARING HER AND WHEN SHE NEXT PEEPED OUT THE FISH FOOTMAN WAS GONE AND THE OTHER WAS SITTING ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR STARING STUPIDLY UP INTO THE SKY ALICE WENT TIMIDLY UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED THERES NO SORT OF USE IN KNOCKING SAID THE FOOTMAN AND THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE IM ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE DOOR AS YOU ARE SECONDLY BECAUSE THEYRE MAKING SUCH A NOISE INSIDE NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HEAR YOU AND CERTAINLY THERE WAS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY NOISE GOING ON CONSTANT HOWLING AND SNEEZING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN A GREAT CRASH AS IF A DISH OR KETTLE HAD BEEN BROKEN TO PIECES PLEASE THEN SAID ALICE HOW AM I TO GET IN THERE MIGHT BE SOME SENSE IN YOUR KNOCKING THE FOOTMAN WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER IF WE HAD THE DOOR BETWEEN US FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE INSIDE YOU MIGHT KNOCK AND I COULD LET YOU OUT YOU KNOW HE WAS LOOKING UP INTO THE SKY ALL THE TIME HE WAS SPEAKING AND THIS ALICE THOUGHT DECIDEDLY UNCIVIL BUT PERHAPS HE CANT HELP IT SHE SAID TO HERSELF HIS EYES ARE SO VERY NEARLY AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD BUT AT ANY RATE HE MIGHT ANSWER AM I TO GET IN SHE REPEATED ALOUD I SHALL SIT HERE THE FOOTMAN REMARKED TILL TOMORROW AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPENED AND A LARGE PLATE CAME SKIMMING OUT STRAIGHT AT THE HEAD IT JUST GRAZED HIS NOSE AND BROKE TO PIECES AGAINST ONE OF THE TREES BEHIND HIM OR NEXT DAY MAYBE THE FOOTMAN CONTINUED IN THE SAME TONE EXACTLY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HOW AM I TO GET IN ASKED ALICE AGAIN IN A LOUDER TONE ARE YOU TO GET IN AT ALL SAID THE FOOTMAN THATS THE FIRST QUESTION YOU KNOW IT WAS NO DOUBT ONLY ALICE DID NOT LIKE TO BE TOLD SO ITS REALLY DREADFUL SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF THE WAY ALL THE CREATURES ARGUE ITS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE CRAZY THE FOOTMAN SEEMED TO THINK THIS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR REPEATING HIS REMARK WITH VARIATIONS I SHALL SIT HERE HE SAID ON AND OFF FOR DAYS AND DAYS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO SAID ALICE ANYTHING YOU LIKE SAID THE FOOTMAN AND BEGAN WHISTLING OH THERES NO USE IN TALKING TO HIM SAID ALICE DESPERATELY HES PERFECTLY IDIOTIC AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN THE DOOR LED RIGHT INTO A LARGE KITCHEN WHICH WAS FULL OF SMOKE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER THE DUCHESS WAS SITTING ON A THREE LEGGED STOOL IN THE MIDDLE NURSING A BABY THE COOK WAS LEANING OVER THE FIRE STIRRING A LARGE CAULDRON WHICH SEEMED TO BE FULL OF SOUP THERES CERTAINLY TOO MUCH PEPPER IN THAT SOUP ALICE SAID TO HERSELF AS WELL AS SHE COULD FOR SNEEZING THERE WAS CERTAINLY TOO MUCH OF IT IN THE AIR EVEN THE DUCHESS SNEEZED OCCASIONALLY AND AS FOR THE BABY IT WAS SNEEZING AND HOWLING ALTERNATELY WITHOUT A MOMENTS PAUSE THE ONLY THINGS IN THE KITCHEN THAT DID NOT SNEEZE WERE THE COOK AND A LARGE CAT WHICH WAS SITTING ON THE HEARTH AND GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR PLEASE WOULD YOU TELL ME SAID ALICE A LITTLE TIMIDLY FOR SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER IT WAS GOOD MANNERS FOR HER TO SPEAK FIRST WHY YOUR CAT GRINS LIKE THAT ITS A CHESHIRE CAT SAID THE DUCHESS AND THATS WHY PIG SHE SAID THE LAST WORD WITH SUCH SUDDEN VIOLENCE THAT ALICE QUITE JUMPED BUT SHE SAW IN ANOTHER MOMENT THAT IT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE BABY AND NOT TO HER SO SHE TOOK COURAGE AND WENT ON AGAIN I DIDNT KNOW THAT CHESHIRE CATS ALWAYS GRINNED IN FACT I DIDNT KNOW THAT CATS COULD GRIN THEY ALL CAN SAID THE DUCHESS AND MOST OF EM DO I DONT KNOW OF ANY THAT DO ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY FEELING QUITE PLEASED TO HAVE GOT INTO A CONVERSATION YOU DONT KNOW MUCH SAID THE DUCHESS AND THATS A FACT ALICE DID NOT AT ALL LIKE THE TONE OF THIS REMARK AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO INTRODUCE SOME OTHER SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO FIX ON ONE THE COOK TOOK THE CAULDRON OF SOUP OFF THE FIRE AND AT ONCE SET TO WORK THROWING EVERYTHING WITHIN HER REACH AT THE DUCHESS AND THE FIRE IRONS CAME FIRST THEN FOLLOWED A SHOWER OF SAUCEPANS PLATES AND DISHES THE DUCHESS TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM EVEN WHEN THEY HIT HER AND THE BABY WAS HOWLING SO MUCH ALREADY THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER THE BLOWS HURT IT OR NOT OH PLEASE MIND WHAT YOURE DOING CRIED ALICE JUMPING UP AND DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TERROR OH THERE GOES HIS PRECIOUS NOSE AS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE SAUCEPAN FLEW CLOSE BY IT AND VERY NEARLY CARRIED IT OFF IF EVERYBODY MINDED THEIR OWN BUSINESS THE DUCHESS SAID IN A HOARSE GROWL THE WORLD WOULD GO ROUND A DEAL FASTER THAN IT DOES WHICH WOULD NOT BE AN ADVANTAGE SAID ALICE WHO FELT VERY GLAD TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING OFF A LITTLE OF HER KNOWLEDGE JUST THINK OF WHAT WORK IT WOULD MAKE WITH THE DAY AND NIGHT YOU SEE THE EARTH TAKES TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO TURN ROUND ON ITS AXIS TALKING OF AXES SAID THE DUCHESS CHOP OFF HER HEAD ALICE GLANCED RATHER ANXIOUSLY AT THE COOK TO SEE IF SHE MEANT TO TAKE THE HINT BUT THE COOK WAS BUSILY STIRRING THE SOUP AND SEEMED NOT TO BE LISTENING SO SHE WENT ON AGAIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I THINK OR IS IT TWELVE I OH DONT BOTHER ME SAID THE DUCHESS I NEVER COULD ABIDE FIGURES AND WITH THAT SHE BEGAN NURSING HER CHILD AGAIN SINGING A SORT OF LULLABY TO IT AS SHE DID SO AND GIVING IT A VIOLENT SHAKE AT THE END OF EVERY LINE SPEAK ROUGHLY TO YOUR LITTLE BOY AND BEAT HIM WHEN HE SNEEZES HE ONLY DOES IT TO ANNOY BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT TEASES CHORUS IN WHICH THE COOK AND THE BABY JOINED WOW WOW WOW WHILE THE DUCHESS SANG THE SECOND VERSE OF THE SONG SHE KEPT TOSSING THE BABY VIOLENTLY UP AND DOWN AND THE POOR LITTLE THING HOWLED SO THAT ALICE COULD HARDLY HEAR THE WORDS I SPEAK SEVERELY TO MY BOY I BEAT HIM WHEN HE SNEEZES FOR HE CAN THOROUGHLY ENJOY THE PEPPER WHEN HE PLEASES CHORUS WOW WOW WOW HERE YOU MAY NURSE IT A BIT IF YOU LIKE THE DUCHESS SAID TO ALICE FLINGING THE BABY AT HER AS SHE SPOKE I MUST GO AND GET READY TO PLAY CROQUET WITH THE QUEEN AND SHE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM THE COOK THREW A FRYING PAN AFTER HER AS SHE WENT OUT BUT IT JUST MISSED HER ALICE CAUGHT THE BABY WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AS IT WAS A QUEER SHAPED LITTLE CREATURE AND HELD OUT ITS ARMS AND LEGS IN ALL DIRECTIONS JUST LIKE A STAR FISH THOUGHT ALICE THE POOR LITTLE THING WAS SNORTING LIKE A STEAM ENGINE WHEN SHE CAUGHT IT AND KEPT DOUBLING ITSELF UP AND STRAIGHTENING ITSELF OUT AGAIN SO THAT ALTOGETHER FOR THE FIRST MINUTE OR TWO IT WAS AS MUCH AS SHE COULD DO TO HOLD IT AS SOON AS SHE HAD MADE OUT THE PROPER WAY OF NURSING IT WHICH WAS TO TWIST IT UP INTO A SORT OF KNOT AND THEN KEEP TIGHT HOLD OF ITS RIGHT EAR AND LEFT FOOT SO AS TO PREVENT ITS UNDOING ITSELF SHE CARRIED IT OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR IF I DONT TAKE THIS CHILD AWAY WITH ME THOUGHT ALICE THEYRE SURE TO KILL IT IN A DAY OR TWO WOULDNT IT BE MURDER TO LEAVE IT BEHIND SHE SAID THE LAST WORDS OUT LOUD AND THE LITTLE THING GRUNTED IN REPLY IT HAD LEFT OFF SNEEZING BY THIS TIME DONT GRUNT SAID ALICE THATS NOT AT ALL A PROPER WAY OF EXPRESSING YOURSELF THE BABY GRUNTED AGAIN AND ALICE LOOKED VERY ANXIOUSLY INTO ITS FACE TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH IT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT IT HAD A VERY TURN UP NOSE MUCH MORE LIKE A SNOUT THAN A REAL NOSE ALSO ITS EYES WERE GETTING EXTREMELY SMALL FOR A BABY ALTOGETHER ALICE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THE THING AT ALL BUT PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY SOBBING SHE THOUGHT AND LOOKED INTO ITS EYES AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY TEARS NO THERE WERE NO TEARS IF YOURE GOING TO TURN INTO A PIG MY DEAR SAID ALICE SERIOUSLY ILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH YOU MIND NOW THE POOR LITTLE THING SOBBED AGAIN OR GRUNTED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH AND THEY WENT ON FOR SOME WHILE IN SILENCE ALICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO THINK TO HERSELF NOW WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THIS CREATURE WHEN I GET IT HOME WHEN IT GRUNTED AGAIN SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO ITS FACE IN SOME ALARM THIS TIME THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IT WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A PIG AND SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE ABSURD FOR HER TO CARRY IT FURTHER SO SHE SET THE LITTLE CREATURE DOWN AND FELT QUITE RELIEVED TO SEE IT TROT AWAY QUIETLY INTO THE WOOD IF IT HAD GROWN UP SHE SAID TO HERSELF IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DREADFULLY UGLY CHILD BUT IT MAKES RATHER A HANDSOME PIG I THINK AND SHE BEGAN THINKING OVER OTHER CHILDREN SHE KNEW WHO MIGHT DO VERY WELL AS PIGS AND WAS JUST SAYING TO HERSELF IF ONE ONLY KNEW THE RIGHT WAY TO CHANGE THEM WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE STARTLED BY SEEING THE CHESHIRE CAT SITTING ON A BOUGH OF A TREE A FEW YARDS OFF THE CAT ONLY GRINNED WHEN IT SAW ALICE IT LOOKED GOOD NATURED SHE THOUGHT STILL IT

MARCH HARE THE HATTER WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT ANY ADVANTAGE FROM THE CHANGE AND ALICE WAS A GOOD DEAL WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE AS THE MARCH HARE HAD JUST UPSET THE MILK JUG INTO HIS PLATE ALICE DID NOT WISH TO OFFEND THE DORMOUSE AGAIN SO SHE BEGAN VERY CAUTIOUSLY BUT I DONT UNDERSTAND WHERE DID THEY DRAW THE TREACLE FROM YOU CAN DRAW WATER OUT OF A WATER WELL SAID THE HATTER SO I SHOULD THINK YOU

CONFUSED POOR ALICE THAT SHE LET THE DORMOUSE GO ON FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT INTERRUPTING IT THEY WERE LEARNING TO DRAW THE DORMOUSE WENT ON YAWNING AND RUBBING ITS EYES FOR IT WAS GETTING VERY SLEEPY AND THEY DREW ALL MANNER OF THAT BEGINS WITH AN M WHY WITH AN M SAID ALICE WHY NOT SAID THE MARCH HARE ALICE WAS SILENT THE DORMOUSE HAD CLOSED ITS EYES BY THIS TIME AND WAS GOING OFF INTO A DOZE BUT ON BEING PINCHED BY THE HATTER IT WOKE UP AGAIN WITH A LITTLE SHRIEK AND WENT ON THAT BEGINS WITH AN M SUCH AS MOUSE TRAPS AND THE MOON AND MEMORY AND KNOW YOU SAY THINGS ARE MUCH OF A YOU EVER SEE SUCH A THING AS A DRAWING OF A MUCHNESS REALLY NOW YOU ASK ME SAID ALICE VERY MUCH CONFUSED I DONT THINK THEN YOU SHOULDNT TALK SAID THE HATTER THIS PIECE OF RUDENESS WAS MORE THAN ALICE COULD BEAR SHE GOT UP IN GREAT DISGUST AND WALKED OFF THE DORMOUSE FELL ASLEEP INSTANTLY AND NEITHER OF THE OTHERS TOOK THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER GOING THOUGH SHE LOOKED BACK ONCE OR TWICE HALF HOPING THAT THEY WOULD CALL AFTER HER THE LAST TIME SHE SAW THEM THEY WERE TRYING TO PUT THE DORMOUSE INTO THE TEAPOT AT ANY RATE ILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN SAID ALICE AS SHE PICKED HER WAY THROUGH THE WOOD ITS THE STUPIDEST TEA PARTY I EVER WAS AT IN ALL MY LIFE JUST AS SHE SAID THIS SHE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE TREES HAD A DOOR LEADING RIGHT INTO IT THATS VERY CURIOUS SHE THOUGHT BUT CURIOUS TODAY I THINK I MAY AS WELL GO IN AT ONCE AND IN SHE WENT ONCE MORE SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE LONG HALL AND CLOSE TO THE LITTLE GLASS TABLE NOW ILL MANAGE BETTER THIS TIME SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND BEGAN BY TAKING THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY AND UNLOCKING THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE GARDEN THEN SHE WENT TO WORK NIBBLING AT THE MUSHROOM SHE HAD KEPT A PIECE OF IT IN HER POCKET TILL SHE WAS ABOUT A FOOT HIGH THEN SHE WALKED DOWN THE LITTLE PASSAGE AND FOUND HERSELF AT LAST IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AMONG THE BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS AND THE COOL FOUNTAINS CHAPTER VIII THE QUEENS CROQUET GROUND A LARGE ROSE TREE STOOD NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN THE ROSES GROWING ON IT WERE WHITE BUT THERE WERE THREE GARDENERS AT IT BUSILY PAINTING THEM RED ALICE THOUGHT THIS A VERY CURIOUS THING AND SHE WENT NEARER TO WATCH THEM AND JUST AS SHE CAME UP TO THEM SHE HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY LOOK OUT NOW FIVE DONT GO SPLASHING PAINT OVER ME LIKE THAT I COULDNT HELP IT SAID FIVE IN A SULKY TONE SEVEN JOGGED MY ELBOW ON WHICH SEVEN LOOKED UP AND SAID THATS RIGHT FIVE ALWAYS LAY THE BLAME ON OTHERS YOUD BETTER NOT TALK SAID FIVE I HEARD THE QUEEN SAY ONLY YESTERDAY YOU DESERVED TO BE BEHEADED WHAT FOR SAID THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST THATS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS TWO SAID SEVEN YES IT IS HIS BUSINESS SAID FIVE AND ILL TELL WAS FOR BRINGING THE COOK TULIP ROOTS INSTEAD OF ONIONS SEVEN FLUNG DOWN HIS BRUSH AND HAD JUST BEGUN WELL OF ALL THE UNJUST THINGS WHEN HIS EYE CHANCED TO FALL UPON ALICE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING THEM AND HE CHECKED HIMSELF SUDDENLY THE OTHERS LOOKED ROUND ALSO AND ALL OF THEM BOWED LOW WOULD YOU TELL ME SAID ALICE A LITTLE TIMIDLY WHY YOU ARE PAINTING THOSE ROSES FIVE AND SEVEN SAID NOTHING BUT LOOKED AT TWO TWO BEGAN IN A LOW VOICE WHY THE FACT IS YOU SEE MISS THIS HERE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A RED ROSE TREE AND WE PUT A WHITE ONE IN BY MISTAKE AND IF THE QUEEN WAS TO FIND IT OUT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE OUR HEADS CUT OFF YOU KNOW SO YOU SEE MISS WERE DOING OUR BEST AFORE SHE COMES TO AT THIS MOMENT FIVE WHO HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY LOOKING ACROSS THE GARDEN CALLED OUT THE QUEEN THE QUEEN AND THE THREE GARDENERS INSTANTLY THREW THEMSELVES FLAT UPON THEIR FACES THERE WAS A SOUND OF MANY FOOTSTEPS AND ALICE LOOKED ROUND EAGER TO SEE THE QUEEN FIRST CAME TEN SOLDIERS CARRYING CLUBS THESE WERE ALL SHAPED LIKE THE THREE GARDENERS OBLONG AND FLAT WITH THEIR HANDS AND FEET AT THE CORNERS NEXT THE TEN COURTIERS THESE WERE ORNAMENTED ALL OVER WITH DIAMONDS AND WALKED TWO AND TWO AS THE SOLDIERS DID AFTER THESE CAME THE ROYAL CHILDREN THERE WERE TEN OF THEM AND THE LITTLE DEARS CAME JUMPING MERRILY ALONG HAND IN HAND IN COUPLES THEY WERE ALL ORNAMENTED WITH HEARTS NEXT CAME THE GUESTS MOSTLY KINGS AND QUEENS AND AMONG THEM ALICE RECOGNISED THE WHITE RABBIT IT WAS TALKING IN A HURRIED NERVOUS MANNER SMILING AT EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID AND WENT BY WITHOUT NOTICING HER THEN FOLLOWED THE KNAVE OF HEARTS CARRYING THE KINGS CROWN ON A CRIMSON VELVET CUSHION AND LAST OF ALL THIS GRAND PROCESSION CAME THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS ALICE WAS RATHER DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIE DOWN ON HER FACE LIKE THE THREE GARDENERS BUT SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING HEARD OF SUCH A RULE AT PROCESSIONS AND BESIDES WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF A PROCESSION THOUGHT SHE IF PEOPLE HAD ALL TO LIE DOWN UPON THEIR FACES SO THAT THEY COULDNT SEE IT SO SHE STOOD STILL WHERE SHE WAS AND WAITED WHEN THE PROCESSION CAME OPPOSITE TO ALICE THEY ALL STOPPED AND LOOKED AT HER AND THE QUEEN SAID SEVERELY WHO IS THIS SHE SAID IT TO THE KNAVE OF HEARTS WHO ONLY BOWED AND SMILED IN REPLY IDIOT SAID THE QUEEN TOSSING HER HEAD IMPATIENTLY AND TURNING TO ALICE SHE WENT ON WHATS YOUR NAME CHILD MY NAME IS ALICE SO PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID ALICE VERY POLITELY BUT SHE ADDED TO HERSELF WHY THEYRE ONLY A PACK OF CARDS AFTER ALL I NEEDNT BE AFRAID OF THEM AND WHO ARE THESE SAID THE QUEEN POINTING TO THE THREE GARDENERS WHO WERE LYING ROUND THE ROSE TREE FOR YOU SEE AS THEY WERE LYING ON THEIR FACES AND THE PATTERN ON THEIR BACKS WAS THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE PACK SHE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THEY WERE GARDENERS OR SOLDIERS OR COURTIERS OR THREE OF HER OWN CHILDREN HOW SHOULD I KNOW SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN COURAGE ITS NO BUSINESS OF MINE THE QUEEN TURNED CRIMSON WITH FURY AND AFTER GLARING AT HER FOR A MOMENT LIKE A WILD BEAST SCREAMED OFF WITH HER HEAD OFF NONSENSE SAID ALICE VERY LOUDLY AND DECIDEDLY AND THE QUEEN WAS SILENT THE KING LAID HIS HAND UPON HER ARM AND TIMIDLY SAID CONSIDER MY DEAR SHE IS ONLY A CHILD THE QUEEN TURNED ANGRILY AWAY FROM HIM AND SAID TO THE KNAVE TURN THEM OVER THE KNAVE DID SO VERY CAREFULLY WITH ONE FOOT GET UP SAID THE QUEEN IN A SHRILL LOUD VOICE AND THE THREE GARDENERS INSTANTLY JUMPED UP AND BEGAN BOWING TO THE KING THE QUEEN THE ROYAL CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY ELSE LEAVE OFF THAT SCREAMED THE QUEEN YOU MAKE ME GIDDY AND THEN TURNING TO THE ROSE TREE SHE WENT ON WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING HERE MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID TWO IN A VERY HUMBLE TONE GOING DOWN ON ONE KNEE AS HE SPOKE WE WERE TRYING I SEE SAID THE QUEEN WHO HAD MEANWHILE BEEN EXAMINING THE ROSES OFF WITH THEIR HEADS AND THE PROCESSION MOVED ON THREE OF THE SOLDIERS REMAINING BEHIND TO EXECUTE THE UNFORTUNATE GARDENERS WHO RAN TO ALICE FOR PROTECTION YOU SHANT BE BEHEADED SAID ALICE AND SHE PUT THEM INTO A LARGE FLOWER POT THAT STOOD NEAR THE THREE SOLDIERS WANDERED ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO LOOKING FOR THEM AND THEN QUIETLY MARCHED OFF AFTER THE OTHERS ARE THEIR HEADS OFF SHOUTED THE QUEEN THEIR HEADS ARE GONE IF IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY THE SOLDIERS SHOUTED IN REPLY THATS RIGHT SHOUTED THE QUEEN CAN YOU PLAY CROQUET THE SOLDIERS WERE SILENT AND LOOKED AT ALICE AS THE QUESTION WAS EVIDENTLY MEANT FOR HER YES SHOUTED ALICE COME ON THEN ROARED THE QUEEN AND ALICE JOINED THE PROCESSION WONDERING VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT A VERY FINE DAY SAID A TIMID VOICE AT HER SIDE SHE WAS WALKING BY THE WHITE RABBIT WHO WAS PEEPING ANXIOUSLY INTO HER FACE VERY SAID ALICE WHERES THE DUCHESS HUSH HUSH SAID THE RABBIT IN A LOW HURRIED TONE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE SPOKE AND THEN RAISED HIMSELF UPON TIPTOE PUT HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO HER EAR AND WHISPERED SHES UNDER SENTENCE OF EXECUTION WHAT FOR SAID ALICE DID YOU SAY WHAT A PITY THE RABBIT ASKED NO I DIDNT SAID ALICE I DONT THINK ITS AT ALL A PITY I SAID WHAT FOR SHE BOXED THE QUEENS EARS THE RABBIT BEGAN ALICE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM OF LAUGHTER OH HUSH THE RABBIT WHISPERED IN A FRIGHTENED TONE THE QUEEN WILL HEAR YOU YOU SEE SHE CAME RATHER LATE AND THE QUEEN SAID GET TO YOUR PLACES SHOUTED THE QUEEN IN A VOICE OF THUNDER AND PEOPLE BEGAN RUNNING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS TUMBLING UP AGAINST EACH OTHER HOWEVER THEY GOT SETTLED DOWN IN A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE GAME BEGAN ALICE THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A CURIOUS CROQUET GROUND IN HER LIFE IT WAS ALL RIDGES AND FURROWS THE BALLS WERE LIVE HEDGEHOGS THE MALLETS LIVE FLAMINGOES AND THE SOLDIERS HAD TO DOUBLE THEMSELVES UP AND TO STAND ON THEIR HANDS AND FEET TO MAKE THE ARCHES THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY ALICE FOUND AT FIRST WAS IN MANAGING HER FLAMINGO SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ITS BODY TUCKED AWAY COMFORTABLY ENOUGH UNDER HER ARM WITH ITS LEGS HANGING DOWN BUT GENERALLY JUST AS SHE HAD GOT ITS NECK NICELY STRAIGHTENED OUT AND WAS GOING TO GIVE THE HEDGEHOG A BLOW WITH ITS HEAD IT WOULD TWIST ITSELF ROUND AND LOOK UP IN HER FACE WITH SUCH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BURSTING OUT LAUGHING AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT ITS HEAD DOWN AND WAS GOING TO BEGIN AGAIN IT WAS VERY PROVOKING TO FIND THAT THE HEDGEHOG HAD UNROLLED ITSELF AND WAS IN THE ACT OF CRAWLING AWAY BESIDES ALL THIS THERE WAS GENERALLY A RIDGE OR FURROW IN THE WAY WHEREVER SHE WANTED TO SEND THE HEDGEHOG TO AND AS THE DOUBLED UP SOLDIERS WERE ALWAYS GETTING UP AND WALKING OFF TO OTHER PARTS OF THE GROUND ALICE SOON CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT GAME INDEED THE PLAYERS ALL PLAYED AT ONCE WITHOUT WAITING FOR TURNS QUARRELLING ALL THE WHILE AND FIGHTING FOR THE HEDGEHOGS AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE QUEEN WAS IN A FURIOUS PASSION AND WENT STAMPING ABOUT AND SHOUTING OFF WITH HIS HEAD OR OFF WITH HER HEAD ABOUT ONCE IN A MINUTE ALICE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY TO BE SURE SHE HAD NOT AS YET HAD ANY DISPUTE WITH THE QUEEN BUT SHE KNEW THAT IT MIGHT HAPPEN ANY MINUTE AND THEN THOUGHT SHE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME THEYRE DREADFULLY FOND OF BEHEADING PEOPLE HERE THE GREAT WONDER IS THAT THERES ANY ONE LEFT ALIVE SHE WAS LOOKING ABOUT FOR SOME WAY OF ESCAPE AND WONDERING WHETHER SHE COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT BEING SEEN WHEN SHE NOTICED A CURIOUS APPEARANCE IN THE AIR IT PUZZLED HER VERY MUCH AT FIRST BUT AFTER WATCHING IT A MINUTE OR TWO SHE MADE IT OUT TO BE A GRIN AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF ITS THE CHESHIRE CAT NOW I SHALL HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK TO HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON SAID THE CAT AS SOON AS THERE WAS MOUTH ENOUGH FOR IT TO SPEAK WITH ALICE WAITED TILL THE EYES APPEARED AND THEN NODDED ITS NO USE SPEAKING TO IT SHE THOUGHT TILL ITS EARS HAVE COME OR AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IN ANOTHER MINUTE THE WHOLE HEAD APPEARED AND THEN ALICE PUT DOWN HER FLAMINGO AND BEGAN AN ACCOUNT OF THE GAME FEELING VERY GLAD SHE HAD SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HER THE CAT SEEMED TO THINK THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH OF IT NOW IN SIGHT AND NO MORE OF IT APPEARED I DONT THINK THEY PLAY AT ALL FAIRLY ALICE BEGAN IN RATHER A COMPLAINING TONE AND THEY ALL QUARREL SO DREADFULLY ONE CANT HEAR ONESELF THEY DONT SEEM TO HAVE ANY RULES IN PARTICULAR AT LEAST IF THERE ARE NOBODY ATTENDS TO YOUVE NO IDEA HOW CONFUSING IT IS ALL THE THINGS BEING ALIVE FOR INSTANCE THERES THE ARCH IVE GOT TO GO THROUGH NEXT WALKING ABOUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE I SHOULD HAVE CROQUETED THE QUEENS HEDGEHOG JUST NOW ONLY IT RAN AWAY WHEN IT SAW MINE COMING HOW DO YOU LIKE THE QUEEN SAID THE CAT IN A LOW VOICE NOT AT ALL SAID ALICE SHES SO EXTREMELY JUST THEN SHE NOTICED THAT THE QUEEN WAS CLOSE BEHIND HER LISTENING SO SHE WENT ON LIKELY TO WIN THAT ITS HARDLY WORTH WHILE FINISHING THE GAME THE QUEEN SMILED AND PASSED ON WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO SAID THE KING GOING UP TO ALICE AND LOOKING AT THE CATS HEAD WITH GREAT CURIOSITY ITS A FRIEND OF CHESHIRE CAT SAID ALICE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE IT I DONT LIKE THE LOOK OF IT AT ALL SAID THE KING HOWEVER IT MAY KISS MY HAND IF IT LIKES ID RATHER NOT THE CAT REMARKED DONT BE IMPERTINENT SAID THE KING AND DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT HE GOT BEHIND ALICE AS HE SPOKE A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING SAID ALICE IVE READ THAT IN SOME BOOK BUT I DONT REMEMBER WHERE WELL IT MUST BE REMOVED SAID THE KING VERY DECIDEDLY AND HE CALLED THE QUEEN WHO WAS PASSING AT THE MOMENT MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE THIS CAT REMOVED THE QUEEN HAD ONLY ONE WAY OF SETTLING ALL DIFFICULTIES GREAT OR SMALL OFF WITH HIS HEAD SHE SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND ILL FETCH THE EXECUTIONER MYSELF SAID THE KING EAGERLY AND HE HURRIED OFF ALICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND SEE HOW THE GAME WAS GOING ON AS SHE HEARD THE QUEENS VOICE IN THE DISTANCE SCREAMING WITH PASSION SHE HAD ALREADY HEARD HER SENTENCE THREE OF THE PLAYERS TO BE EXECUTED FOR HAVING MISSED THEIR TURNS AND SHE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS AT ALL AS THE GAME WAS IN SUCH CONFUSION THAT SHE NEVER KNEW WHETHER IT WAS HER TURN OR NOT SO SHE WENT IN SEARCH OF HER HEDGEHOG THE HEDGEHOG WAS ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH ANOTHER HEDGEHOG WHICH SEEMED TO ALICE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR CROQUETING ONE OF THEM WITH THE OTHER THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS THAT HER FLAMINGO WAS GONE ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDEN WHERE ALICE COULD SEE IT TRYING IN A HELPLESS SORT OF WAY TO FLY UP INTO A TREE BY THE TIME SHE HAD CAUGHT THE FLAMINGO AND BROUGHT IT BACK THE FIGHT WAS OVER AND BOTH THE HEDGEHOGS WERE OUT OF SIGHT BUT IT DOESNT MATTER MUCH THOUGHT ALICE AS ALL THE ARCHES ARE GONE FROM THIS SIDE OF THE GROUND SO SHE TUCKED IT AWAY UNDER HER ARM THAT IT MIGHT NOT ESCAPE AGAIN AND WENT BACK FOR A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION WITH HER FRIEND WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE CHESHIRE CAT SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND QUITE A LARGE CROWD COLLECTED ROUND IT THERE WAS A DISPUTE GOING ON BETWEEN THE EXECUTIONER THE KING AND THE QUEEN WHO WERE ALL TALKING AT ONCE WHILE ALL THE REST WERE QUITE SILENT AND LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE MOMENT ALICE APPEARED SHE WAS APPEALED TO BY ALL THREE TO SETTLE THE QUESTION AND THEY REPEATED THEIR ARGUMENTS TO HER THOUGH AS THEY ALL SPOKE AT ONCE SHE FOUND IT VERY HARD INDEED TO MAKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID THE EXECUTIONERS ARGUMENT WAS THAT YOU COULDNT CUT OFF A HEAD UNLESS THERE WAS A BODY TO CUT IT OFF FROM THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD TO DO SUCH A THING BEFORE AND HE WASNT GOING TO BEGIN AT HIS TIME OF LIFE THE KINGS ARGUMENT WAS THAT ANYTHING THAT HAD A HEAD COULD BE BEHEADED AND THAT YOU WERENT TO TALK NONSENSE THE QUEENS ARGUMENT WAS THAT IF SOMETHING WASNT DONE ABOUT IT IN LESS THAN NO TIME SHED HAVE EVERYBODY EXECUTED ALL ROUND IT WAS THIS LAST REMARK THAT HAD MADE THE WHOLE PARTY LOOK SO GRAVE AND ANXIOUS ALICE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO SAY BUT IT BELONGS TO THE DUCHESS YOUD BETTER ASK HER ABOUT IT SHES IN PRISON THE QUEEN SAID TO THE EXECUTIONER FETCH HER HERE AND THE EXECUTIONER WENT OFF LIKE AN ARROW THE CATS HEAD BEGAN FADING AWAY THE MOMENT HE WAS GONE AND BY THE TIME HE HAD COME BACK WITH THE DUCHESS IT HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED SO THE KING AND THE EXECUTIONER RAN WILDLY UP AND DOWN LOOKING FOR IT WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY WENT BACK TO THE GAME CHAPTER IX THE MOCK TURTLES STORY YOU CANT THINK HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN YOU DEAR OLD THING SAID THE DUCHESS AS SHE TUCKED HER ARM AFFECTIONATELY INTO AND THEY WALKED OFF TOGETHER ALICE WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND HER IN SUCH A PLEASANT TEMPER AND THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THE PEPPER THAT HAD MADE HER SO SAVAGE WHEN THEY MET IN THE KITCHEN WHEN IM A DUCHESS SHE SAID TO HERSELF NOT IN A VERY HOPEFUL TONE THOUGH I WONT HAVE ANY PEPPER IN MY KITCHEN AT ALL SOUP DOES VERY WELL ITS ALWAYS PEPPER THAT MAKES PEOPLE HOT TEMPERED SHE WENT ON VERY MUCH PLEASED AT HAVING FOUND OUT A NEW KIND OF RULE AND VINEGAR THAT MAKES THEM CAMOMILE THAT MAKES THEM BARLEY SUGAR AND SUCH THINGS THAT MAKE CHILDREN SWEET TEMPERED I ONLY WISH PEOPLE KNEW THAT THEN THEY WOULDNT BE SO STINGY ABOUT IT YOU KNOW SHE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE DUCHESS BY THIS TIME AND WAS A LITTLE STARTLED WHEN SHE HEARD HER VOICE CLOSE TO HER EAR YOURE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING MY DEAR AND THAT MAKES YOU FORGET TO TALK I CANT TELL YOU JUST NOW WHAT THE MORAL OF THAT IS BUT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN A BIT PERHAPS IT HASNT ONE ALICE VENTURED TO REMARK TUT TUT CHILD SAID THE DUCHESS GOT A MORAL IF ONLY YOU CAN FIND IT AND SHE SQUEEZED HERSELF UP CLOSER TO SIDE AS SHE SPOKE ALICE DID NOT MUCH LIKE KEEPING SO CLOSE TO HER FIRST BECAUSE THE DUCHESS WAS VERY UGLY AND SECONDLY BECAUSE SHE WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT HEIGHT TO REST HER CHIN UPON SHOULDER AND IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLY SHARP CHIN HOWEVER SHE DID NOT LIKE TO BE RUDE SO SHE BORE IT AS WELL AS SHE COULD THE GAMES GOING ON RATHER BETTER NOW SHE SAID BY WAY OF KEEPING UP THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE TIS SO SAID THE DUCHESS AND THE MORAL OF THAT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND SOMEBODY SAID ALICE WHISPERED THAT ITS DONE BY EVERYBODY MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AH WELL IT MEANS MUCH THE SAME THING SAID THE DUCHESS DIGGING HER SHARP LITTLE CHIN INTO SHOULDER AS SHE ADDED AND THE MORAL OF THAT CARE OF THE SENSE AND THE SOUNDS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HOW FOND SHE IS OF FINDING MORALS IN THINGS ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF I DARE SAY YOURE WONDERING WHY I DONT PUT MY ARM ROUND YOUR WAIST THE DUCHESS SAID AFTER A PAUSE THE REASON IS THAT IM DOUBTFUL ABOUT THE TEMPER OF YOUR FLAMINGO SHALL I TRY THE EXPERIMENT HE MIGHT BITE ALICE CAUTIOUSLY REPLIED NOT FEELING AT ALL ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE EXPERIMENT TRIED VERY TRUE SAID THE DUCHESS FLAMINGOES AND MUSTARD BOTH BITE AND THE MORAL OF THAT OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER ONLY MUSTARD ISNT A BIRD ALICE REMARKED RIGHT AS USUAL SAID THE DUCHESS WHAT A CLEAR WAY YOU HAVE OF PUTTING THINGS ITS A MINERAL I THINK SAID ALICE OF COURSE IT IS SAID THE DUCHESS WHO SEEMED READY TO AGREE TO EVERYTHING THAT ALICE SAID THERES A LARGE MUSTARD MINE NEAR HERE AND THE MORAL OF THAT MORE THERE IS OF MINE THE LESS THERE IS OF YOURS OH I KNOW EXCLAIMED ALICE WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED TO THIS LAST REMARK ITS A VEGETABLE IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE ONE BUT IT IS I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE DUCHESS AND THE MORAL OF THAT WHAT YOU WOULD SEEM TO IF YOUD LIKE IT PUT MORE IMAGINE YOURSELF NOT TO BE OTHERWISE THAN WHAT IT MIGHT APPEAR TO OTHERS THAT WHAT YOU WERE OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN WAS NOT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT YOU HAD BEEN WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO THEM TO BE OTHERWISE I THINK I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IF I

THE OWL HAD THE DISH AS ITS SHARE OF THE TREAT WHEN THE PIE WAS ALL FINISHED THE OWL AS A BOON WAS KINDLY PERMITTED TO POCKET THE SPOON WHILE THE PANTHER RECEIVED KNIFE AND FORK WITH A GROWL AND

DISTANCE COME ON CRIED THE GRYPHON AND TAKING ALICE BY THE HAND IT HURRIED OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE END OF THE SONG WHAT TRIAL IS IT ALICE PANTED AS SHE RAN BUT THE GRYPHON ONLY ANSWERED COME ON AND RAN THE FASTER WHILE MORE AND MORE FAINTLY CAME CARRIED ON THE BREEZE THAT FOLLOWED THEM THE MELANCHOLY WORDS OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SOUP CHAPTER XI WHO STOLE THE TARTS THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS WERE SEATED ON THEIR THRONE WHEN THEY ARRIVED WITH A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED ABOUT SORTS OF LITTLE BIRDS AND BEASTS AS WELL AS THE WHOLE PACK OF CARDS THE KNAVE WAS STANDING BEFORE THEM IN CHAINS WITH A SOLDIER ON EACH SIDE TO GUARD HIM AND NEAR THE KING WAS THE WHITE RABBIT WITH A TRUMPET IN ONE HAND AND A SCROLL OF PARCHMENT IN THE OTHER IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE COURT WAS A TABLE WITH A LARGE DISH OF TARTS UPON IT THEY LOOKED SO GOOD THAT IT MADE ALICE QUITE HUNGRY TO LOOK AT WISH THEYD GET THE TRIAL DONE SHE THOUGHT AND HAND ROUND THE REFRESHMENTS BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANCE OF THIS SO SHE BEGAN LOOKING AT EVERYTHING ABOUT HER TO PASS AWAY THE TIME ALICE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A COURT OF JUSTICE BEFORE BUT SHE HAD READ ABOUT THEM IN BOOKS AND SHE WAS QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE KNEW THE NAME OF NEARLY EVERYTHING THERE THATS THE JUDGE SHE SAID TO HERSELF BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT WIG THE JUDGE BY THE WAY WAS THE KING AND AS HE WORE HIS CROWN OVER THE WIG LOOK AT THE FRONTISPIECE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW HE DID IT HE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL COMFORTABLE AND IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT BECOMING AND THATS THE JURY BOX THOUGHT ALICE AND THOSE TWELVE CREATURES SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SAY CREATURES YOU SEE BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE ANIMALS AND SOME WERE BIRDS I SUPPOSE THEY ARE THE JURORS SHE SAID THIS LAST WORD TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER TO HERSELF BEING RATHER PROUD OF IT FOR SHE THOUGHT AND RIGHTLY TOO THAT VERY FEW LITTLE GIRLS OF HER AGE KNEW THE MEANING OF IT AT ALL HOWEVER JURY MEN WOULD HAVE DONE JUST AS WELL THE TWELVE JURORS WERE ALL WRITING VERY BUSILY ON SLATES WHAT ARE THEY DOING ALICE WHISPERED TO THE GRYPHON THEY CANT HAVE ANYTHING TO PUT DOWN YET BEFORE THE TRIALS BEGUN THEYRE PUTTING DOWN THEIR NAMES THE GRYPHON WHISPERED IN REPLY FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD FORGET THEM BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL STUPID THINGS ALICE BEGAN IN A LOUD INDIGNANT VOICE BUT SHE STOPPED HASTILY FOR THE WHITE RABBIT CRIED OUT SILENCE IN THE COURT AND THE KING PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ROUND TO MAKE OUT WHO WAS TALKING ALICE COULD SEE AS WELL AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS THAT ALL THE JURORS WERE WRITING DOWN STUPID THINGS ON THEIR SLATES AND SHE COULD EVEN MAKE OUT THAT ONE OF THEM DIDNT KNOW HOW TO SPELL STUPID AND THAT HE HAD TO ASK HIS NEIGHBOUR TO TELL HIM A NICE MUDDLE THEIR BE IN BEFORE THE TRIALS OVER THOUGHT ALICE ONE OF THE JURORS HAD A PENCIL THAT SQUEAKED THIS OF COURSE ALICE COULD NOT STAND AND SHE WENT ROUND THE COURT AND GOT BEHIND HIM AND VERY SOON FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING IT AWAY SHE DID IT SO QUICKLY THAT THE POOR LITTLE JUROR IT WAS BILL THE LIZARD COULD NOT MAKE OUT AT ALL WHAT HAD BECOME OF IT SO AFTER HUNTING ALL ABOUT FOR IT HE WAS OBLIGED TO WRITE WITH ONE FINGER FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND THIS WAS OF VERY LITTLE USE AS IT LEFT NO MARK ON THE SLATE HERALD READ THE ACCUSATION SAID THE KING ON THIS THE WHITE RABBIT BLEW THREE BLASTS ON THE TRUMPET AND THEN UNROLLED THE PARCHMENT SCROLL AND READ AS

UNEASILY AT THE QUEEN AND IN HIS CONFUSION HE BIT A LARGE PIECE OUT OF HIS TEACUP INSTEAD OF THE BREAD AND BUTTER JUST AT THIS MOMENT ALICE FELT A VERY CURIOUS SENSATION WHICH PUZZLED HER A GOOD DEAL UNTIL SHE MADE OUT WHAT IT WAS SHE WAS BEGINNING TO GROW LARGER AGAIN AND SHE THOUGHT AT FIRST SHE WOULD GET UP AND LEAVE THE COURT BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS SHE DECIDED TO REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS AS LONG

SHRILL LITTLE VOICE THE NAME ALICE CHAPTER XII EVIDENCE HERE CRIED ALICE QUITE FORGETTING IN THE FLURRY OF THE MOMENT HOW LARGE SHE HAD GROWN IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES AND SHE JUMPED UP IN SUCH A HURRY THAT SHE TIPPED OVER THE JURY BOX WITH THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT UPSETTING ALL THE JURYMEN ON TO THE HEADS OF THE CROWD BELOW AND THERE THEY LAY SPRAWLING ABOUT REMINDING HER VERY MUCH OF A GLOBE OF GOLDFISH SHE HAD ACCIDENTALLY UPSET THE WEEK BEFORE OH I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF GREAT DISMAY AND BEGAN PICKING THEM UP AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD FOR THE ACCIDENT OF THE

DREAMING AFTER A FASHION AND THIS WAS HER DREAM FIRST SHE DREAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HERSELF AND ONCE AGAIN THE TINY HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON HER KNEE AND THE BRIGHT EAGER EYES WERE LOOKING UP INTO COULD HEAR THE VERY TONES OF HER VOICE AND SEE THAT QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD TO KEEP BACK THE WANDERING HAIR THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HER STILL AS SHE LISTENED OR SEEMED TO LISTEN THE WHOLE PLACE AROUND HER BECAME ALIVE WITH THE STRANGE CREATURES OF HER LITTLE SISTERS DREAM THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AT HER FEET AS THE WHITE RABBIT HURRIED FRIGHTENED MOUSE SPLASHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURING COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE TEACUPS AS THE MARCH HARE AND HIS FRIENDS SHARED THEIR NEVER ENDING MEAL AND THE SHRILL VOICE OF THE QUEEN ORDERING OFF HER UNFORTUNATE GUESTS TO MORE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE KNEE WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CRASHED AROUND MORE THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON THE SQUEAKING OF THE LIZARDS SLATE PENCIL AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN AND ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL GRASS WOULD BE ONLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND THE POOL RIPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE RATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP BELLS AND THE QUEENS SHRILL CRIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON AND ALL THE OTHER QUEER NOISES WOULD CHANGE SHE KNEW TO THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF THE BUSY FARM THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TURTLES HEAVY SOBS LASTLY SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF HOW THIS SAME LITTLE SISTER OF HERS WOULD IN THE AFTER TIME BE HERSELF A GROWN WOMAN AND HOW SHE WOULD KEEP THROUGH ALL HER RIPER YEARS THE SIMPLE AND LOVING HEART OF HER CHILDHOOD AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHER ABOUT HER OTHER LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT AND EAGER WITH MANY A STRANGE TALE PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE DREAM OF WONDERLAND OF LONG AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS AND FIND A PLEASURE IN ALL THEIR SIMPLE JOYS REMEMBERING HER OWN CHILD LIFE AND THE HAPPY SUMMER DAYS THE END
