# Investigator Alligator - Forensics - ? points - ? solves

JoSchmoTechCo's server got hit! The folder containing their super duper important company secrets is all locked up. Luckily, the sysadmin was smart enough to be capturing the network traffic and take a memory sample when the whole ordeal went down.

The victim user, in a flurry of blind panic, also typed something after the damage was already done. We have an image of the disk after the event. Can you recover their files and find out what the victim typed?

Note: the malware contained is rather innocuous, but it's still a bad idea to run untrusted programs off the Internet. Please don't do that.

  - The file is literally so large that we can't host it on our IrisCTF R2 or else it'll exceed the quota, so this is hosted on my personal S3 instead.
